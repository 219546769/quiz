# ScriptEd Buzzfeed Quiz!

## Project Description
Using JavaScript functions, you will build a quiz  app that will determine at which tech company the user will be placed. You'll need to have a way to provide the users different placements based on their specific input. If two users input the same answers, they should receive the same result. Follow the steps below to make your very own site!
